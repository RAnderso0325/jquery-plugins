  			<div class="text">
    			<p>It's nice to be around people that have a sense of the world around them, that are, in general, more conscious and conscientious. I could be pensive, uhh... smart, supersticious, brave? And I, uhh, I can be light on my feet. If I drive for you, you get your money. We're always changing. Anything happens a minute either side of that, and you're on your own.</p>

				<div id=tab1text><p>For example, the sun goes up and then it goes down. I wrote you 365 letters. I'm going to get to ride the bike up, rob it, and ride the bank away. I give you five minutes when we get there. Change moves in spirals, not circles.</p></div>

  			<h3>Gosling Says</h3>
  			<div class="text">
    			<p>I hear about actors who become the role and I think 'I wonder what that feels like'. All my characters are me. In most movies you spend so much time looking for any scraps of truth, and in this movie you're just marinating in it. Then, telling Derek Cianfrance that I'd ever I could rob a bank I'd do it on my motorcycle, and he said 'That's weird, I just wrote a script about that'. I won't eat my cereal.</p>

			<h3>Gosling Says</h3>
			<div class="text">
    			<p>I get sick of myself, so I can imagine how everyone else feels. And I just turn up the parts of myself that are them and turn down the parts that aren't. I drive. When you breathe, you inhale and you exhale, but every single time that you do that you're a little bit different then the one before. I relate to these characters because aspects of their personality are like me.</p>
    			<p>You just tell me what you want, and I'm gonna be that for you. He said that I was going to get to rob the bank for real. Hey girl, I brought home a few bottles of wine since I know you needed more corks for that pinterest project. I don't sit in while you're running it down. Anything happens in that five minutes, then I'm yours, no matter what.</p>
